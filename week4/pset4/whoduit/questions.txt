1.  The header <stdint.h> is a structure that declares sets of integer types having specified widths.
2.  uintN_t designates an unsigned integer type with width N (width = # of bits)
3.
    BYTE - 8 bits
    DWORD - 32 bits
    LONG - 32 bits (signed integer)
    WORD - 16 bits.
4.  BM, which is 0x42 0x4D in hexadecimal.
5.  bfSize is an attribute of BITMAPFILEHEADER while biSize is from BITMAPINFOHEADER.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.
8.  Out of free memory.
9.  We want to read from 1 element of the specfied size to the next one (to divide the pixels).
10. 3
11. fseek, allows you to change the location of the file pointer. Offset refers to how many bytes you want to change the current position of the file pointer fp.
12. Current position of the file pointer.
