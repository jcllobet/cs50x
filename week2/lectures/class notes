doing buggy0
we cannot do printf since we didn't incluse stdio.h

help50 helps you. It looks at the program line by line and ask some specific questions
like a virtual ts/ta

buggy1 --> always focus on the first of those messages. 

Try to learn as much as you can from the error messages.
eprintf() --> print errors on the screen 


program debug50: built in graphical debugger step by step. 
debug50 ./buggy3
we have to tell it where to look at in the code. (red dot)
step over, step into

man --> give me the computer's manual. 

int main(void). Main itself does not take any arguemnts.
The input has to be obtained by another function

We can specify for this to be done in the command line ./string1 marta

int main (int argc, string argv[])
argv[] array of strings!! YAY

an array is a list of similar values back to back (list)
A string is just an array of chars

Arcv is an array of strings. 
./ argv0 Zamyla --> [./argv0\0, Zamayla\0]
