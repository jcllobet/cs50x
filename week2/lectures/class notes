# class notes

doing buggy0
we cannot do printf since we didn't incluse stdio.h

help50 helps you. It looks at the program line by line and ask some specific questions
like a virtual ts/ta

buggy1 --> always focus on the first of those messages. 

Try to learn as much as you can from the error messages.
eprintf() --> print errors on the screen 


program debug50: built in graphical debugger step by step. 
debug50 ./buggy3
we have to tell it where to look at in the code. (red dot)
step over, step into

man --> give me the computer's manual.
